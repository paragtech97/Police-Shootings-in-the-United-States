Project Report

Abstract
This project involves the exploration and analysis of police shootings data to gain insights into various demographic factors associated with such incidents. The analysis covers aspects like the size of the dataset, missing values, date ranges, and demographic characteristics of individuals involved in police shootings. Additionally, the report delves into incident-specific details and evaluates the potential use of excessive force, examining whether it is disproportionately directed towards specific racial groups.

Motivation
Police shootings are significant societal concerns, and understanding the demographic patterns and circumstances surrounding these incidents is crucial for addressing issues related to law enforcement and public safety. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of police shootings, shedding light on potential disparities in the use of force across different demographic groups.

Background
The dataset used in this project contains information on police shootings, including details about the individuals involved, such as their race, age, gender, and circumstances leading to the incident. The analysis involves exploring the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and potential associations with demographic factors.

My Work
Part A: Dataset Size
The size of the dataset was explored, revealing information about the total size in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes. Additionally, the number of rows and columns for each sheet in the dataset was determined.

Part B: Missing Values
The total number of missing values in the dataset was calculated, providing insights into the extent of missing data in each column for two specific sheets, 'data1' and 'data2'.

Part C: Date Range
The range of dates in the dataset was determined, offering an understanding of the temporal scope of the police shootings data.

Demographic Analysis
1.	Median Age of Individuals Shot
The median age of all individuals shot by police was calculated, and an analysis of age groups was presented through a bar graph.

2.	Median Age by Race
The median age for each racial group was determined, and the age distribution within each race was visualized using a grouped bar chart.

3.	Shot Rate per Capita
The shot rate per capita was calculated for different racial groups, considering population percentages. The results were presented in a grouped bar chart, highlighting disparities in the age groups.

4.	Data Distribution by Race and Gender
The distribution of data based on race and gender was analyzed, providing insights into the intersectionality of these demographic factors in police shootings.

Incident Analysis Leading to the Shooting
1.	Unique Incidents
The unique incidents leading to police shootings, including threat types, flee status, weapons used, and body camera presence, were explored.

2.	Confrontation and Risk by Race
The likelihood of different racial groups confronting the police and facing a higher risk of being shot was analyzed. The analysis considered armed individuals and their threat types.
Excessive Force Analysis
The analysis aimed to determine whether police employed excessive force and if this force was disproportionately directed towards specific racial groups. The justification for the use of force was examined based on threat types.

Results
The analysis revealed various insights into demographic patterns, incident characteristics, and the potential use of excessive force in police shootings. Disparities across different racial groups, age brackets, and gender categories were observed, shedding light on the complexities of these incidents.

Conclusion
The findings from this analysis contribute to the understanding of police shootings, emphasizing the importance of addressing disparities and promoting transparency in law enforcement practices. The insights gained can inform discussions on policy reforms, community policing, and efforts to ensure fair and just treatment for all individuals.
